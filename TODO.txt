MAYBE:
checkboxes in ir list header cells to filter presets by snapshot
upload IR names file
get rid of the empty [0] elem in irUsage

make it more testable
	support analyzing individual preset files
	ideally with an "expected result" field, or something

resolve whether IR assigned to block should count if snapshots are used

use setlist names from files instead of filename, maybe
	things is, would be nice to show cols in that order, not that easy
	also, actual names might not be unique
