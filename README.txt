WHAT IS THIS?
This is a tool for working with the Line 6 Helix guitar processor.
It lets you quickly determine which IRs are used by a collection of presets, and which presets use them.
Just drag up to 8 Helix setlist files onto the page, it'll do the rest.
NOTE: Only setlist files (.hls) are supported, not bundles, full backups, or presets.
It's 100% free and always will be.

IMPORTANT:
This tool requires a recent mainstream browser, like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
It is known NOT to work in Internet Explorer, and other browsers haven't been tested.

WEB SITE
You don't have to install HIRB to use it if you have internet access, which you probably do if you're reading this :)
Instead, navigate your browser to:
  http://www.dave-merrill.com/helix/hirb/

INSTALLATION AND USE
If you want to install it on your own machine:
Download anywhere on your computer, then double click index.html to view it in your default browser.
Use your operating system's usual maneuvers to open it in a different browser if desired.
Chrome probably runs the quickest, but it's pretty fast anyway.
